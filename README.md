# ESG-Based-Portfolio-Optimization-using-Modern-Portfolio-Theory-CAC40-
Research project exploring ESG inclusion in Modern Portfolio Theory, analysing its effects on diversification, Sharpe ratios, and overall portfolio efficiency using CAC40 data

## 📘 Overview
This project explores how Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria can be incorporated into Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) when constructing and optimising portfolios.  
Using data from CAC40 companies, the study compares traditional portfolios with ESG-screened portfolios in terms of performance, risk, Sharpe ratio, and diversification.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess the impact of ESG criteria on portfolio construction.
- Compare risk–return characteristics of ESG vs. non-ESG portfolios.
- Implement mean-variance optimisation (Markowitz Model).
- Analyse changes in asset allocation after applying ESG criteria.
